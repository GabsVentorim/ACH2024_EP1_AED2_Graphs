# GRAPHS - ACH2024

Template for the project of the course [ACH2024 - Algorithms and Data Structures II][1]
at University of SÃ£o Paulo (@USP).

# Goal

Develop a program using the C language, implementing graphs, that solves the problem of choosing the maximum size of a 
truck from one place to another, based on the bridges heights along the way. 

## Running the code

If you are using the matrix implementation:
```bash
make ep1_matriz.exe 
```
```bash
./ep1_matriz.exe entrada.txt
```

If you are using the list implementation:
```bash
make ep1_lista.exe  
```
```bash
./ep1_matriz.exe entrada.txt
```
